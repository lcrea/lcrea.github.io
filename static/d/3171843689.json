Here's a few:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Be positive. A positive mind always tries to find the beauty and the good in anything and anyone.</li>\n<li>Be proactive. If there is a problem you can solve, then solve it! Don't wait somebody else to do it for you.</li>\n<li>Knowledge means freedom. Never stop learning.</li>\n<li>Flexibility is the most valuable asset nowadays.</li>\n<li>Quality, not quantity.</li>\n<li>Waste of resources is a mindset (and a cancer for this planet).</li>\n<li>Respect is a mindset (and the solution to many many problems).</li>\n<li>Everything around you is the final result of somebody else work. Respect it!</li>\n<li>Do not work hard. Work smart! Time is finite. Don't waste it in worthless activities.</li>\n<li>Multitasking yields poor productivity. Do one thing at the time and give it everything you got.</li>\n<li>Do not judge and label anything or anyone (even if sometimes it's hard). Be open minded.</li>\n<li>Think for yourself and do not believe in anything anybody says.</li>\n<li>When you have a doubt, look up the original source for the answer.</li>\n<li>Always choose the solution with the higher impact on your life/business/relation.</li>\n<li>Honesty is the foundation of any relationship.</li>\n<li>Trust requires time and effort to be built. Never screw it up!</li>\n<li>Fake, negative, toxic people are just dead wood and need to be cut out from your life. You deserve more.</li>\n<li>When somebody is talking, stay quiet and listen to them.</li>\n<li>Any incomprehension can be solved talking.</li>\n</ul>"}}]},"page":{"frontmatter":{"title":"About me"},"html":"<p>Hi everyone ðŸ‘‹ my name is Luca Crea and I'm a software engineer, but I prefer to consider myself a tech geek with +10 years of multidisciplinary experience, especially in open source.</p>\n<p>I'm an endless and humble learner and a believer of technology as a way to innovate, to save resources and to create opportunities.</p>\n<p>Whenever I can, I love trying something new, instead of constantly applying the same techniques. This slows me a bit, sometimes, but at the end it's always worth it: it helps me to grow, to stay updated, but most of all, <strong>it's fun</strong>! ðŸ˜Ž</p>"}}}
